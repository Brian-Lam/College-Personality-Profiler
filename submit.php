			<p>I had a great freshman year, although one or two of my friends left. Speaking of friends, <strong>most of my friends are <?php echo $personality->mostFriends(); ?></strong>, but I know several Asian people and a couple black people.</p>

			<p>Nevertheless, we are a really queer-friendly schoolâ€”we&#8217;re all very accepting.</p>

			<p>There are about <?php echo intval($personality->getUndergrads() / 4) ?> students in my grade, so I see the same faces around a lot, but I don&#8217;t know everyone. About half the people I see every day are men, half women.</p>

			<p>Most of the people I know are from out of state.<?php
				$r = $personality->getForeign();
				// echo $personality->getForeign();
				// echo "\n";
				// echo $personality->getUndergrads();
				if($r > 5) {
					$r = round(100 / $r);
					echo " About 1 in " . $r . "of my friends is from outside the US, too.";
				}
			?></p>

			<!-- <p>I might have seen {your FB friends who attend this school} around campus.</p> -->

			<p>About a third of my friends get scholarship money, which is helpful because it costs about <strong>$40,000 a year</strong> to go here otherwise. Everyone who needed financial aid got it, though.</p>

			<p>I got a <strong><?php echo $personality->getACT(); ?></strong> on my ACT and a <strong><?php echo $personality->getSAT()[0] + $personality->getSAT()[1] + $personality->getSAT()[2]; ?></strong> my SAT.</p>

			<p>I don&#8217;t know anyone who graduated in the bottom half of their class, and <strong>most of my friends were in the top 10%</strong>.</p>

			<p>We have very few &#8220;standard&#8221; classes that everyone takes, but a lot of people are majoring in the social sciences, engineering, and business.</p>

			<p>Greek life&#8217;s not that big here. About <strong>1 in <?php echo intval(1 / $personality->getFrat()); ?> of my male friends joined fraternities</strong>, and <strong>1 in <?php echo intval(1 / $personality->getSoro()); ?> of my female friends joined sororities</strong>.</p>

			<p>Very few people care about sports, even though our women&#8217;s soccer team, men&#8217;s basketball team, and women&#8217;s basketball team are the best D3 teams in the Midwest.</p>

			<p>In fact, so few people attend our games, we don&#8217;t even have some attendances recorded!</p>
