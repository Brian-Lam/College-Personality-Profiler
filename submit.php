			<h2>Location</h2>

			<p>
				It's in the midwest - in <strong>St. Louis, Missouri</strong>, to be precise - so (of course) the weather is absolutely terrible. 
				It rains a ton. It snows a ton. And it gets really hot in the summer. We have a 51 degree fluctuation in the average temperature between summer and winter!

				Wear snow boots!

			<blockquote>
			<p>We don&#8217;t have a very diverse campus.</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>I had a great freshman year, although one or two of my friends left. Speaking of friends, <strong>most of my friends are white</strong>, but I know several Asian people and a couple black people.</p>

			<p>Nevertheless, we are a really queer-friendly schoolâ€”we&#8217;re all very accepting.</p>

			<p>There are about 1600 students in my grade, so I see the same faces around a lot, but I don&#8217;t know everyone. About half the people I see every day are men, half women.</p>

			<p>Most of the people I know are from out of state. About one in ten of my friends is from outside the US, too.</p>

			<p>I might have seen {your FB friends who attend this school} around campus.</p>

			<p>About a third of my friends get scholarship money, which is helpful because it costs about <strong>$40,000 a year</strong> to go here otherwise. Everyone who needed financial aid got it, though.</p>

			<blockquote>
			<p>Wash U students are <em>really</em> smart.</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>I got a <strong>33</strong> on my ACT and a <strong>2215</strong> my SAT.</p>

			<p>I don&#8217;t know anyone who graduated in the bottom half of their class, and <strong>most of my friends were in the top 10%</strong>.</p>

			<p>We have very few &#8220;standard&#8221; classes that everyone takes, but a lot of people are majoring in the social sciences, engineering, and business.</p>

			<p>Greek life&#8217;s not that big here. About <strong>1 in 4 of my male friends joined fraternities</strong>, and <strong>1 in 4 of my female friends joined sororities</strong>.</p>

			<p>Very few people care about sports, even though our women&#8217;s soccer team, men&#8217;s basketball team, and women&#8217;s basketball team are the best D3 teams in the Midwest.</p>

			<p>In fact, so few people attend our games, we don&#8217;t even have some attendances recorded!</p>
