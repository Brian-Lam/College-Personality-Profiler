# Washington University in St. Louis #

Hi! I go to **Washington University in St. Louis**, or, as I like to call it, **Wash U**.  I'm probably white, or maybe Asian, and I'm a premed or biomed major.

I'm not from here; I live out of state. The school's pretty small, so I recognize a lot of the people I see, but I don't know everyone, if you know what I mean.

It's really seriously cold over here, and it snows a lot. Also rain. Lots of rain.

I graduated in the top half of my class, and I got a 32 on the ACT and a 2100 on SAT.

We don't give a flying pony about our sports teams, even though our Women's Soccer team is fairly strong.

I cuss like a ducking sailor, and I am fairly positive.
