So you can get school FB IDs by searching on the Graph API.

https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/145634995501895/?method=GET&path=search%3Fq%3DWashington%2BUniversity%2Bin%2BSt.%2BLouis%26type%3Dpage&version=v2.1

will search for Washington University in St. Louis. Just vary the q for each school

Once you have an ID, you can get the cover photo:

graph.facebook.com/v2.1/{id}?field=cover

And that's all we need for now.
