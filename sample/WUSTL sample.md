# Washington University in St. Louis #

<[ **Hi!** I go to **WashU**, but you might know it is as **Washington University in St. Louis**.

[Map embed]

## Location ##

<[ Pack snow boots!

It's in the midwest— in **St. Louis, Missouri**, to be precise— so (of course) the weather is absolutely terrible. It rains a ton. It snows a ton. And it gets really hot in the summer.

## Size and Diversity ##

<[ We don't have a very diverse campus.

I had a great freshman year, although one or two of my friends left. Speaking of friends, **most of my friends are white**, but I know several Asian people and a couple black people.

There are about 1600 students in my grade, so I see the same faces around a lot, but I don't know everyone.

I might have seen {your FB friends who attend this school} around campus.

About a third of my friends get scholarship money, which is helpful because it costs about **$40,000 a year** to go here otherwise. Everyone who needed financial aid got it, though.

## Academics ##

<[ Wash U students are *really* smart.

I got a **33** on my ACT and a **2215** my SAT.

I don't know anyone who graduated in the bottom half of their class, and **most of my friends were in the top 10%**.

<[ something quip about classes

We have very few "standard" classes that everyone takes,  but a lot of people are majoring in biology, chemistry, and engineering.

## Extracurriculars ##

Greek life's not that big here. About 1 in 4 of us joined fraternities.

<[ You might be surprised that we don't have a yearbook.
